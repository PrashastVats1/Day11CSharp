Based on the recorded results of the performance analysis for different array sizes, we can observe the following:

Performance Comparison:
For 100 elements, all three sorting algorithms perform reasonably well and have similar execution times.
Bubble sort-> 0.1642 milliseconds, Selection sort-> 0.1939 milliseconds, Insertion sort-> 0.1091 milliseconds

For 500 elements, Selection Sort is noticeably faster than Bubble Sort, while Insertion Sort performs similarly to Bubble Sort.
Bubble sort-> 0.8018 milliseconds, Selection sort-> 0.3135 milliseconds, Insertion sort-> 0.1929 milliseconds

For 5000 elements, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort are significantly faster than Bubble Sort.
Bubble sort-> 76.1017 milliseconds, Selection sort-> 28.6221 milliseconds, Insertion sort-> 17.529 milliseconds

For 10000 elements, the performance gap between Bubble Sort and the other two algorithms widens, with Bubble Sort taking significantly more time to sort the array.
Bubble sort-> 312.1582 milliseconds, Selection sort-> 114.2238 milliseconds, Insertion sort-> 75.0173 milliseconds

Analysis:
Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort exhibits poor performance for larger arrays. It is relatively inefficient for larger datasets.
It performs reasonably well for smaller arrays and partially sorted data.
It has the advantage of being a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm with in-place sorting.

Selection Sort:
Selection Sort shows better performance than Bubble Sort for larger datasets as, it performs fewer swaps, making it more efficient.
Selection Sort performs well for small arrays but is not as efficient as more advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.

Insertion Sort:
Insertion Sort exhibits similar performance to Bubble Sort and Selection Sort for small arrays and partially sorted data.
It should performs well when the array is nearly sorted.
Like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, Insertion Sort is not recommended for larger datasets where faster algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort are more suitable.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:
Advantages:
Simple to understand and implement.
Requires minimal additional memory space, as it performs in-place sorting.
Can perform well on small datasets or partially sorted arrays.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.
Lacks adaptiveness, as it doesn't perform significantly better on nearly sorted data.
Not recommended for real-world applications or large-scale systems where faster sorting algorithms are available.

Conclusion:
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort are simple sorting algorithms suitable for small datasets or partially sorted arrays.
For larger datasets, the performance of Bubble Sort degrades significantly compared to Selection Sort and Insertion Sort, which perform better.
If efficiency is a concern, especially for larger arrays, it is recommended to use more advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which offer superior performance in practice.
